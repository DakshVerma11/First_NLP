## Key Concepts

- **Subword Tokenization**: Techniques such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece are explored for creating subword units from text, which help in handling out-of-vocabulary words in NLP tasks.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Various models, including those using embeddings, are tested and compared to evaluate their effectiveness in predicting sentiment from text data.

- **Text Generation**: Notebooks provide step-by-step processes to generate text using deep learning models, with a focus on LSTM and optimized versions.
